# Mitchell MacKnight Project Showcase

Welcome to my personal code portfolio. Here I showcase a selection of my personal and academic projects. These projects reflect my interests, creative abilities, and skills in various technologies.

## About Me

My passion is building software that brings people together in meaningful ways. I believe in creating socially interactive products that are not only enjoyable, but also help to build communities and foster relationships between people. The technologies that I develop are intended to be used and enjoyed by people and relate to topics of interest to me.

## Projects

On this site, you'll find detailed information about each project, including its current state and links to its codebase. Additionally, I'll keep you informed about the new features that are coming to each project in the future. Whether you're here to explore my work or collaborate on a project, I hope you'll find something that interests you.

Thank you for visiting my project showcase! If you have any questions or would like to discuss a project, please don't hesitate to contact me.
